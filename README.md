# TypingGame
TypingGame is a typing game built with vanilla JavaScript.

It uses JS to keep track of word-per-minutes, number of errors while typing,
matching typed texts with provided texts among other front-end logics.

It uses the Django framework in the backend to support random text for each
typing session and a Leaderboard of players with the highest word-per-minute.
